# Penumbra

Our team made a Chrome extension in React that smart inverts videos in the browser for QWER Hacks 2021. 


## Inspiration
We were inspired by technologies that change color rendering to ease eye strain.

## What it does
Penumbra is a chrome extension that inverts bright colors of videos in the browser, allowing users to play videos in "dark mode" while preserving the color scheme of the rest of the browser.

## How we built it
Penumbra was built as a chrome extension, and uses React to modify webpage elements.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Penumbra successfully inverts the colors of videos, including those which are live streamed.  Our "smart inversion" tool preserves color hues, and maintains desired aesthetics of the original video better than some other color inversion technologies.

## What we learned
We all learned how to build a chrome extension for the first time.  For some of our team members, it was our first experience using react and figma.

## What's next for Penumbra
We are considering functionality that would prevent Penumbra from inverting videos that are already recorded with a dark color scheme.  At the moment, the user needs to manually toggle inverter.  We also plan to publish Penumbra to the chrome web store, so that other students may use it.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
