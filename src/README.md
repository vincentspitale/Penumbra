## Inspiration
We were inspired by technologies that change color rendering to ease eye strain.

## What it does
Penumbra is a chrome extension that inverts bright colors of videos in the browser, allowing users to play videos in "dark mode" while preserving the color scheme of the rest of the browser.

## How we built it
Penumbra was built as a chrome extension, and uses React to modify webpage elements.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Penumbra successfully inverts the colors of videos, including those which are live streamed.  Our "smart inversion" tool preserves color hues, and maintains desired aesthetics of the original video better than some other color inversion technologies.

## What we learned
We all learned how to build a chrome extension for the first time.  For some of our team members, it was our first experience using react and figma.

## What's next for Penumbra
We are considering functionality that would prevent Penumbra from inverting videos that are already recorded with a dark color scheme.  At the moment, the user needs to manually toggle inverter.  We also plan to publish Penumbra to the chrome web store, so that other students may use it.
